You MUST ALWAYS return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "Question text here?",
      "answer": "",
      "category": "Task|Persona|Conditions|Instructions"
    }
  ],
  "variables": [
    {
      "id": "v1",
      "name": "VariableName",
      "value": "",
      "category": "Content|Style|Technical|Custom",
      "technicalTerms": [
        {
          "term": "Technical term that needs explanation",
          "explanation": "Simple 2-3 sentence explanation for non-technical users",
          "example": "A practical example showing how to find or use this value"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "masterCommand": "A clear, concise summary of what needs to be done",
  "enhancedPrompt": "An improved version of the original prompt"
}

Guidelines for Questions:
1. Generate UP TO 4 questions per pillar (Task, Persona, Conditions, Instructions)
2. Focus on the most critical context needed for each pillar
3. Use simple, non-technical language
4. Start with essential questions first
5. Skip pillars that have sufficient context

Guidelines for Variables:
1. Create 1-8 variables total, only what's truly needed
2. Focus on customizable elements that affect multiple parts
3. Make variables reusable and clear
4. For technical terms, ALWAYS provide:
   - A clear, simple explanation (2-3 sentences)
   - A practical example showing how to find or use the value
   - Focus on helping non-technical users understand

Remember:
- Questions must have unique IDs (q1, q2, etc)
- Variables must have unique IDs (v1, v2, etc)
- All fields are required
- Never leave any field empty or null
- Questions must align with framework pillars`;

  }
  if (secondaryToggle) {
